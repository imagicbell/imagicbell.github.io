So I decided to move it to Unity. However, due to the incompatibility and dissimilarity of the two platforms, I have to reimplement the core logic in C#, and provide specific impementations for the code runner and UI, which make up <a href=\"https://github.com/imagicbell/ublockly\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">UBlockly</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"section-showcase\">Showcase</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/blog/assets/img-blockly/Demo.png\" alt=\"\"> <img src=\"/blog/assets/img-blockly/DemoLog.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"section-modularization\">Modularization</h2>\n<p>UBlockly consists of 3 modules: Blockly Model, Code Interpreter and Runner, UI. </p>\n<p>Blockly Model is the core logic, which is translated from Google Blockly. </p>\n<p>Code Interpreter is <em>IEnumerator</em>-based mechanism for interpreting block behaviors in C# functions.
