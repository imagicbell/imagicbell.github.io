We got a son. His come had brought big changes to not only our life, but also our mind. We took a serious retrospect of our life and career, and discussed our future, our dream. Finally, we reached an agreement  on the bold decision: move to Canada. Actually, it was not the first time that came to our discussion, but never was taken into actions. Since then, my husband began to devote most of his spare time in preparations for job seeking in Canada. I quit my job for taking care of our baby, as well as self-learning Web technologies more broadly and professionally. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, COVID-9 had come to ruin the world, as well as our plans. The country seemed to close the door. No job opportunities. No Visa permitted. It was frustrating and tough. Both of us were under high pressure for a period. However, we didn't give up. The world was recovering. We threw negative attitudes away and focused on what we could do. God helps those who help themselves. My husband got an opportunity in Amazon Vancouver. Inspired by his success, my preparations for jumping into Web industries are going better and better.</p></div></div></div><div data-aos="fade-up" class="flex items-start flex-col md:flex-row mb-16"><div class="px-12 pb-4 w-full md:w-1/3 flex justify-center md:justify-end"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMTgwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjE4MCIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB2ZXJzaW9uPSIxLjEiLz4="/></div><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" class="rounded-2xl" style="visibility:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/></div></div><div class="w-full md:w-2/3 lg:mr-16"><div class="text-xl text-blue-500">Senior Unity Developer</div><div class="text-xl text-yellow-500">Bloks Group</div><div class="flex items-center text-theme-meta mb-8"><span>October 2016 - March 2020</span><div class="w-px h-px border rounded mx-4 border-theme-meta"></div><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="map-marker-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-map-marker-alt fa-w-12 h-4 mr-1" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 384 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M172.268 501.67C26.97 291.031 0 269.413 0 192 0 85.961 85.961 0 192 0s192 85.961 192 192c0 77.413-26.97 99.031-172.268 309.67-9.535 13.774-29.93 13.773-39.464 0zM192 272c44.183 0 80-35.817 80-80s-35.817-80-80-80-80 35.817-80 80 35.817 80 80 80z"></path></svg><span>Shanghai, China</span></div><div class="markdown-body markdown-styles_markdown__1x9gM"><p>It was a tough time after the failure in <em>Com2Ply</em>. Meanwhile I began to realize the uncertainty of the game market. I decided to seek opportunities in other markets, which were more connected to our life. I joined <em>Putao</em>(ex-name of <em>Bloks Group</em>), a medium company targeting at Kid's Play and Education. During the early period in <em>Putao</em>, I led or joined in the development of several educational apps, such as story Ebook, English Learning App, and Coding Robot. It was sincerely a happy period in my career, as I had met several colleagues with whom I collaborated quite well and shared common interests. More importantly, I had seen more possibilities in what I could do. My vision had been broaden. I began to develop my own interest in spare time. This was how <a href="https://github.com/imagicbell/ublockly" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ublockly</a> came to life. </p>
<p>However, in my late second year in <em>Putao</em>, it began to change its business, pouring all its effort to making toy bricks for kids, like <em>Lego</em>. I took the responsibility to lead the development of an internal tool, Block Editor, for designers to build block models. It was more like a Desktop App, involving a model editing window, complicated UI, file system, and massive resources exchange with server. I began to realize the inconvenience and painfulness of developing such an App using Unity. So I began to dive in Web technologies.</p></div></div></div><div data-aos="fade-up" class="flex items-start flex-col md:flex-row mb-16"><div class="px-12 pb-4 w-full md:w-1/3 flex justify-center md:justify-end"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMTgwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjE4MCIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB2ZXJzaW9uPSIxLjEiLz4="/></div><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" class="rounded-2xl" style="visibility:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/></div></div><div class="w-full md:w-2/3 lg:mr-16"><div class="text-xl text-blue-500">Unity Game Developer</div><div class="text-xl text-yellow-500">Com2Ply</div><div class="flex items-center text-theme-meta mb-8"><span>August 2014 - September 2016</span><div class="w-px h-px border rounded mx-4 border-theme-meta"></div><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="map-marker-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-map-marker-alt fa-w-12 h-4 mr-1" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 384 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M172.268 501.67C26.97 291.031 0 269.413 0 192 0 85.961 85.961 0 192 0s192 85.961 192 192c0 77.413-26.97 99.031-172.268 309.67-9.535 13.774-29.93 13.773-39.464 0zM192 272c44.183 0 80-35.817 80-80s-35.817-80-80-80-80 35.817-80 80 35.817 80 80 80z"></path></svg><span>Shanghai, China</span></div><div class="markdown-body markdown-styles_markdown__1x9gM"><p>It was a bold decision to join <em>Com2Ply</em>, a startup just founded but consisted of several famous professionals in the game industry.

My duty was implementing the gameplay, including avatar skills, AI, battle effects, score calculation, etc. It was a crucial and difficult task. However, I was guided by an expert in this specific field. From this collaboration, I had learned a lot from his rich experience. His desire to dive deep and the way of thinking outside the box also inspired me and influenced me ever since in my career. Thanks to this opportunity, I had grown fast. </p>
<p>In the middle term, we created a very satisfying game, with which we gained a huge funding and support from a big game company.
