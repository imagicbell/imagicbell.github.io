It was a tough time after the failure in *Com2Ply*. Meanwhile I began to realize the uncertainty of the game market. I decided to seek opportunities in other markets, which were more connected to our life. I joined *Putao*(ex-name of *Bloks Group*), a medium company targeting at Kid's Play and Education. During the early period in *Putao*, I led or joined in the development of several educational apps, such as story Ebook, English Learning App, and Coding Robot. It was sincerely a happy period in my career, as I had met several colleagues with whom I collaborated quite well and shared common interests. More importantly, I had seen more possibilities in what I could do. My vision had been broaden. I began to develop my own interest in spare time. This was how [ublockly](https://github.com/imagicbell/ublockly) came to life. 

However, in my late second year in *Putao*, it began to change its business, pouring all its effort to making toy bricks for kids, like *Lego*. I took the responsibility to lead the development of an internal tool, Block Editor, for designers to build block models. It was more like a Desktop App, involving a model editing window, complicated UI, file system, and massive resources exchange with server. I began to realize the inconvenience and painfulness of developing such an App using Unity. So I began to dive in Web technologies.
