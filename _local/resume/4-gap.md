The year of 2019 was special for my family. We got a son. His come had brought big changes to not only our life, but also our mind. We took a serious retrospect of our life and career, and discussed our future, our dream. Finally, we reached an agreement  on the bold decision: move to Canada. Actually, it was not the first time that came to our discussion, but never was taken into actions. Since then, my husband began to devote most of his spare time in preparations for job seeking in Canada. I quit my job for taking care of our baby, as well as self-learning Web technologies more broadly and professionally. 

Unfortunately, COVID-9 had come to ruin the world, as well as our plans. The country seemed to close the door. No job opportunities. No Visa permitted. It was frustrating and tough. Both of us were under high pressure for a period. However, we didn't give up. The world was recovering. We threw negative attitudes away and focused on what we could do. God helps those who help themselves. My husband got an opportunity in Amazon Vancouver. Inspired by his success, my preparations for jumping into Web industries are going better and better.
