wish to start a new game. but no opportunity in triniti interactive
So I joined a group of game developing professionals, who had plenty of successful experience in creating RPG games. 
Our aim was to create an RPG game with cool battle effects. 
My duty is to lead the implementation of game logic, including avatar skills, AI, scores, etc.
Unfortunately, we failed because of running out of money.
