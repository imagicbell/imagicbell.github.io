It was a bold decision to join *Com2Ply*, a startup just founded but consisted of several famous professionals in the game industry. Our initial aim was to develop a mobile ARPG game, making our gamers experience fantastic battle. My duty was implementing the gameplay, including avatar skills, AI, battle effects, score calculation, etc. It was a crucial and difficult task. However, I was guided by an expert in this specific field. From this collaboration, I had learned a lot from his rich experience. His desire to dive deep and the way of thinking outside the box also inspired me and influenced me ever since in my career. Thanks to this opportunity, I had grown fast. 

In the middle term, we created a very satisfying game, with which we gained a huge funding and support from a big game company. However, at last we failed to continue because of much interference from this big company and some uncontrollable issues. However, it was a valuable experience and had great influence in my career.
